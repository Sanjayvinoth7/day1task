HTTP      :

                Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol  or  HTTP  ,it  is  based  on  the  client - server  model. The  protocol  is  used  for  communication 
between  the  web  browser and  web  server. There  is  a  evalution  in  the  HTTP,  HTTP1.1  and  HTTP2  is  one  of  them.


HTTP/1.1 :

                 The  Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol  or  HTTP1.1  is  standardized  protocol. It  is  faster  than  the  HTTP. HTTP1.1  is  used  in  
every  places. HTTP1.1  keeps  all  the  request  in  the  plain  text  format. It  uses  request  resource  line  for  getting  multiple  pages. 
HTTP1.1 must  implement  GET  method  and  is  used  to  put  request. HTTP1.1  is  load  for  every  TCP  connection  one  by  one.                       
                                                                   
   
 HTTP/2   :

                 The  Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol  or  HTTP2  is  faster , better  and  secure  than  the  HTTP1.1. HTTP2  is  a  protocol  for 
 greater  performance. HTTP2  using  binary  protocol  and  it  is  multiplexed. HTTP2  is  used  in  several  places  only.  It  is  a 
binary  protocol  which  no.of  request  can  goes  through  the single  TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).  In  HTTP2 , PUSH 
method  happen  in  the  server.
